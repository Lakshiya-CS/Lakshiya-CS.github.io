    <h1>Lakshiya's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Lakshiya, a Computer Science major at Weber State University currently in my third semester. I chose CS because I am curious about how technology impacts our lives and love solving problems with code. I'm also a big math nerd, so it just clicks naturally for me. For my previous semesters, I took CS 1400 (Python), CS 2550 (SQL/Databases), CS 1030(Foundation of Computing) and CS 1410(Object-Oriented Programming), which deepened my interest in programming and working with data. This semester I have taken this class - WEB 1430 to strenghten my skills in Javascript, CYBR 2300(Intro to Networking and Cybersecurity) and CS 2450(Software Engineering I). Outside of tech, I like movies, music and reading books more specifically fiction or dystopian genre. I'm excited to keep growing my skills and see where this journey takes me!<br>
    I am developing this portfolio website to primarily showcase my Javascript projects.
