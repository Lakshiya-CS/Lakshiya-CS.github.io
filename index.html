    <h1>Lakshiya's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Lakshiya, a Computer Science major at Weber State University currently in my third semester. I chose CS because I am curious about how technology impacts our lives and love solving problems with code. I'm also a big math nerd, so it just clicks naturally for me.
    <br>For my previous semesters, I took:
        <li>CS 1400 (Python)</li>
        <li>CS 2550 (SQL/Databases)</li>
        <li>CS 1030(Foundation of Computing)</li> 
        <li>CS 1410(Object-Oriented Programming)</li>
    which deepened my interest in programming and working with data. 
    <br>
    <br>This semester I am enrolled in
    <li>WEB 1430 to strenghten my skills in Javascript</li> 
    <li>CYBR 2300(Intro to Networking and Cybersecurity)</li>
    <li>CS 2450(Software Engineering I)</li><br>
    Outside of tech, I like movies, music and reading books more specifically fiction or dystopian genre. I'm excited to keep growing my skills and see where this journey takes me!<br>
    I am developing this portfolio website to primarily showcase my Javascript projects.
